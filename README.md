# `JIGSAW-MODELS`

<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dengwirda/jigsaw">`JIGSAW`</a> is a Delaunay-based unstructured mesh generator for two- and three-dimensional geometries. It is designed to generate high-quality triangular and tetrahedral meshes for planar, surface and volumetric problems.

This repository offers a collection of 3D surface models generated using `JIGSAW`. Each model can be viewed and manipulated online using `Github`'s support for `STL`-based geometry files. Simply select any geometry file in the repository to load the `STL` model viewer and manipulate the scene using the mouse.

`JIGSAW` is a stand-alone mesh generator written in `C++`, currently available for `64-bit` `Windows` and `Linux` platforms. `JIGSAW` can be downloaded as either (i) a <a href="https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw">command-line program</a>, or (ii) as part of a <a href="https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw-matlab">`MATLAB` / `OCTAVE` toolbox</a>, providing cross-platform visualisation and mesh post-processing facilities.

Additional information, documentation, online tutorials and references for `JIGSAW` are available <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dengwirda/jigsaw">here</a>.
