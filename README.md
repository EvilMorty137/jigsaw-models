# `JIGSAW-MODELS`

<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dengwirda/jigsaw">`JIGSAW`</a> is a Delaunay-based unstructured mesh generator for two- and three-dimensional geometries - designed to generate high-quality triangular and tetrahedral meshes for planar, surface and volumetric problems.

This repository offers a collection of 3D models generated using `JIGSAW` - view-able online using `Github's` inline `WebGL`-based support for `STL` files.
